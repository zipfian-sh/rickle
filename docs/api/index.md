# API Reference

`rickle` can be used programmatically as a Python library, providing a clean and intuitive API for working with configuration files and structured data. Developers can `add()`, `get()`, `set()`/`put()`, and transform data using functions like `dict()`, `list()` across formats such as YAML, JSON, TOML, INI, XML, and ENV. 
The API is designed for flexibility making it easy to integrate `rickle` into scripts, applications, or automation workflows where configuration management is needed.
